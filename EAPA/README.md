## :wrench: Training
Please refer to the README.md in the folder "./training"

## :wrench: Example: have a try
Before running the example file, please ensure that you have completed the environment configuration in "./training/environment.yaml".

Due to the size limitations for supplementary materials, we only attach the Lora weights of model training here for your reference, which is available at "./lora_weights.safetensors". 

You can have a try using the following command line:

```bash
python example.py --device "cuda:0" --lora_path "./lora_weights.safetensors" --prompt "morgan freeman, by martine johanna, by Loish, by Greg Rutkowski, strong shadows, by Rossdraws, artgerm, smooth, sharp focus, artstation, Detailed and Intricate, beauty, backlighting"
